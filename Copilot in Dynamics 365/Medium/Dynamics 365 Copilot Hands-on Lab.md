## Exercise 1: Sales Manager - Monitor and coach your team with Copilot
In this exercise, you will assume the role of a sales manager and use Copilot to monitor and coach your team. You will learn how to use Copilot to:
- View and analyze your team's performance and pipeline
- Get insights and recommendations on how to improve your team's results
- Provide feedback and guidance to your team members
- Create and assign tasks and activities to your team members
### Step 1: View and analyze your team's performance and pipeline
1. Open your web browser and navigate to your Dynamics 365 trial environment.
2. Sign in with your credentials and select the Sales Hub app.
3. On the left navigation pane, select Copilot.
4. On the Copilot dashboard, you will see a summary of your team's performance and pipeline, such as the number of open opportunities, the revenue forecast, the win rate, and the average deal size. You can also see the individual performance of each team member and compare them with the team average.
5. To get more details and insights, you can use voice or text commands to interact with Copilot. For example, you can say or type "Show me the pipeline by stage" to see a breakdown of the opportunities by sales stage. You can also filter the results by team member, product, industry, or any other criteria.
6. Copilot will respond with a visual and verbal answer, and provide additional information and suggestions. For example, Copilot might say "You have 25 opportunities in the qualification stage, totaling $[URL] million. This is 40% of your total pipeline. You might want to focus on moving these opportunities to the next stage."
7. You can also ask Copilot follow-up questions or drill down into specific opportunities. For example, you can say or type "Show me the details of the largest opportunity in the qualification stage" to see more information about that opportunity, such as the account name, the contact name, the product, the estimated close date, and the probability.
8. Copilot will respond with the details and also provide recommendations and best practices. For example, Copilot might say "The largest opportunity in the qualification stage is ABC Inc., worth $250,000. The contact name is John Smith, the product is Dynamics 365 Sales, the estimated close date is March 31, and the probability is 60%. You should schedule a discovery call with John Smith and send him a product brochure."
### Step 2: Get insights and recommendations on how to improve your team's results
1. On the Copilot dashboard, you can also see a list of insights and recommendations that Copilot generates based on your team's data and activities. These insights and recommendations can help you identify and address potential issues, opportunities, and best practices.
2. For example, you might see an insight that says "Your team's win rate is lower than the industry average. You should review your sales process and identify the areas for improvement." You can click on the insight to see more details and suggestions, such as the comparison of your team's win rate with the industry average, the factors that affect the win rate, and the best practices to increase the win rate.
3. You can also ask Copilot for insights and recommendations on specific topics or scenarios. For example, you can say or type "How can I increase the average deal size of my team?" to get suggestions on how to upsell and cross-sell to your existing and potential customers.
4. Copilot will respond with a list of possible actions and strategies, such as offering discounts, bundles, or add-ons, targeting larger accounts, or qualifying leads more effectively. You can also ask Copilot for more details or examples on each action or strategy.
### Step 3: Provide feedback and guidance to your team members
1. On the Copilot dashboard, you can also see a list of tasks and activities that your team members have completed or are due to complete. You can use this information to provide feedback and guidance to your team members and help them achieve their goals.
2. For example, you might see a task that says "Call John Smith from ABC Inc. to confirm the product demo" that is assigned to one of your team members. You can click on the task to see more details, such as the status, the priority, the due date, and the notes.
3. You can also use voice or text commands to interact with Copilot and provide feedback and guidance to your team member. For example, you can say or type "How did the call with John Smith go?" to get a summary of the call, such as the duration, the sentiment, the topics, and the outcomes.
4. Copilot will respond with the summary and also provide suggestions and best practices. For example, Copilot might say "The call with John Smith lasted 15 minutes. The sentiment was positive. The topics discussed were the product features, the pricing, and the next steps. The outcome was that John Smith agreed to attend the product demo on March 15. You should send a follow-up email to John Smith and confirm the demo details."
5. You can also ask Copilot follow-up questions or provide feedback and guidance to your team member. For example, you can say or type "Good job on the call. You should also mention the customer success stories and the testimonials in the email." Copilot will acknowledge your feedback and guidance and send it to your team member.
### Step 4: Create and assign tasks and activities to your team members
1. On the Copilot dashboard, you can also create and assign tasks and activities to your team members using voice or text commands. You can use this feature to delegate work, assign responsibilities, and track progress.
2. For example, you can say or type "Create a task for Jane Doe to send a proposal to XYZ Ltd. by March 10" to create a new task and assign it to one of your team members.
3. Copilot will confirm the task details and ask you for any additional information, such as the priority, the description, or the attachments. You can provide the information or skip it if not applicable.
4. Copilot will create the task and assign it to your team member. You can also see the task on the Copilot dashboard and on the Dynamics 365 Sales app.
5. You can also use voice or text commands to modify or delete existing tasks and activities. For example, you can say or type "Change the due date of the task to send a proposal to XYZ Ltd. to March 15" to update the task details. You can also say or type "Delete the task to send a proposal to XYZ Ltd." to remove the task. Copilot will confirm the changes and notify your team member.
