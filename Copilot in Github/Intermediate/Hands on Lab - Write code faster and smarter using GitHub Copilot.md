# Hands on Lab - Write code faster and smarter using GitHub Copilot
In this lab, you will learn how to use GitHub Copilot to write code faster and smarter. You will use the Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code and explore some of its features and capabilities. You will also learn how to customize Copilot's suggestions and provide feedback to improve its quality.
## Prerequisites
To complete this lab, you will need the following:
- A GitHub account
- Visual Studio Code installed on your machine
- The GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code installed on your machine
- A basic understanding of the programming language you want to use ([URL]., Python, JavaScript, etc.)
## Steps
1. Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file with the extension of your preferred programming language ([URL]., .py, .js, etc.).
2. In the bottom right corner of the editor, you should see a Copilot icon. Click on it to activate Copilot.
3. Start typing some code in your file. You should see Copilot's suggestions appear as gray text in the editor. You can press Tab to accept a suggestion, or use the arrow keys to navigate through different suggestions.
4. Try to write a simple program that takes a user's input and prints a greeting message. For example, in Python, you could write something like this:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
5. As you write your code, notice how Copilot adapts to your coding style and preferences. You can also use comments to give Copilot hints on what you want to do. For example, you could write something like this:
```python
# ask the user for their favorite color
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
# print a message based on their color
```
6. Copilot will try to complete your comment with a suitable code snippet. You can accept it or modify it as you wish.
7. To customize Copilot's suggestions, you can use the Copilot settings in Visual Studio Code. Go to File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Copilot". You can adjust the settings according to your needs. For example, you can change the suggestion frequency, the suggestion style, the preferred line length, etc.
8. To provide feedback to Copilot, you can use the Copilot feedback panel in Visual Studio Code. Go to View > Copilot Feedback. You can rate the suggestions you received, report issues, and suggest improvements. You can also see the feedback you have given so far and edit or delete it.
9. Congratulations! You have completed the GitHub Copilot Intermediate Lab. You have learned how to use Copilot to write code faster and smarter, how to customize its suggestions, and how to provide feedback to improve its quality.
