# Hands-on exercise: Using built-in system features for Intune data retrieval
In this exercise, you will learn how to use the built-in system features for Intune data retrieval. Intune is a cloud-based service that allows you to manage and secure your devices, apps, and data. You can use Intune to collect various types of data from your devices, such as hardware inventory, software inventory, compliance status, and device configuration. You can also use Intune to export or download the data for further analysis or reporting.
## Prerequisites
To complete this exercise, you will need:
- An Azure AD account with Intune administrator role.
- A device enrolled in Intune.
- A web browser.
## Steps
Follow these steps to use the built-in system features for Intune data retrieval.
1. Sign in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center.
2. In the left navigation pane, select **Devices**.
3. In the **Devices** blade, you can see the list of devices enrolled in Intune. You can use the filters, search, and columns to find the device or devices you want to retrieve data from.
4. Select one or more devices from the list, and then click **More** in the top menu.
5. In the **More** menu, you can see the following options for data retrieval:
- **Export to CSV**: This option allows you to export the device information to a comma-separated values (CSV) file. You can choose which columns to include in the file, and then download it to your local computer.
- **Get report**: This option allows you to generate a report that contains the device information and the device compliance status. You can choose the report format (PDF or Excel), and then download it to your local computer.
- **Sync**: This option allows you to manually sync the device with Intune, and update the device information and the device compliance status.
- **Collect diagnostics**: This option allows you to collect diagnostic data from the device, such as logs, policies, and settings. You can choose the diagnostic categories to collect, and then download the data as a ZIP file to your local computer.
6. Choose one of the options from the **More** menu, and follow the instructions on the screen to retrieve the data from the device or devices.
7. After you download the data, you can open it with the appropriate application, such as Excel, PDF reader, or ZIP extractor, and view or analyze the data as needed.
